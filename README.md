Hi, my name is Henrique. I am 28 years old and I currently work as a dev jr. Technology fell on parachutes in my life a little late, until, when I came across, I was graduating in another area without even liking it. Even at that time, the challenges of solving small problems were already consuming me, I was always fascinated by a screen with several lines of code knowing that they could impact the world so much. Nothing like a notebook and spotify playing a rap to help build something big.
